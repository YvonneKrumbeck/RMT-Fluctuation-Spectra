## To create figures:

1. in MATLAB run fig1sim.m
2. in MATLAB run fig2sim.m
3. in MATLAB run fig3sim.m
4. in Python run fig4.py
5. in MATLAB run f5.m (first download 41467_2017_2571_MOESM6_ESM.xlsx from Nature Communications, 9:266, 2018)
6. in Mathematica run Figure7

## Requirements: 

* A recent version of MATLAB (we used 2019b)
* An up to date Python installation
* A Wolfram Mathematica installation

## Install time:

A few minutes to install MATLAB, Python and Mathematica

## Expected output:

Reproductions of figures included in the submission of _Fluctuation spectra of large random dynamical systems reveal hidden structure in ecological networks,_ https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05140
